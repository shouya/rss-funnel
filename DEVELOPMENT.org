* Inspector front-end

I typically run the following command to watch for any front-end source changes and rebuild the assets.

#+begin_src
cd inspector && pnpm watch
#+end_src

The built assets will be under =inspector/dist= directory. The asset files will be picked up in the =inspector.rs= module via [[https://github.com/pyrossh/rust-embed/tree/master][rust-embed]] and served at =/_inspector/dist= path prefix.

* Watch and re-build automatically

I typically run the following command to rebuild on changes.

#+begin_src bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo watch -c -x 'run -- -c ~/.config/rss-funnel/funnel.yaml server' -w ~/.config/rss-funnel/funnel.yaml -w src/ -w Cargo.toml
#+end_src

Note that I didn't watch the =inspector/dist= directory because in debug mode the assets are served from the file system.

* Building the project

1. build the inspector front-end: =cd inspector && pnpm build=
2. build the rust project: =cargo build --release=
